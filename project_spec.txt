Project 1
=========
Objective:
Scrape product data and use the difference between the Web Selling Price and the generated Invoice Line Cost Price to calculate Invoice Line Product Margin ($ and %)
Steps - Data:
-------------
(1) Scrape products from Walmart and create Products - Product Name (the search term),  Product Description, Web Selling Price, Rating
(2) Using the scraped product data create a series of Invoices and Invoice Lines each linked to a Product
(3) When creating the Invoice Lines, apply a % reduction to the Web Selling Price to create new columns of Cost Price, Margin % and Margin $
(4) Alter some of the Invoice Line product cost prices to simulate an invoice line with a margin outlier

Steps - Dashboard:
------------------
Enter: product search terms to scrape
Tab 1 - display scraped data
Tab 2 - display auto generated invoice lines based on scraped data, ranked in order of margin %
Test - Detect an Invoice Line with a product whose margin exceeds a user specified discrepancy threshold %
